> I can't overstate how much more productive I am since I ditched the obsolete Core Data framework and started to use GRDB instead.
>
> The hard stuff is doable, and the simple stuff is even simpler, as it should be.

> Yes, I much prefer GRDB. I’ve tested many SQLite wrappers over the years 💜

> SQLite using @groue’s GRDB, no brainer! Awesome documentation, support and beautifully designed.

> We get Core Data from Apple which is the worst library to deal with.
> Then there is Realm which is nice but again you do not get the RAW SQL power as it is its own type of Db.
> Then comes the most beautiful library every written which is very close to Room called GRDB.

> When I first started using GRDB I didn't know SQL or much at all about databases 😬 So I've always really liked the query API. But these days I really appreciate that you support raw SQL too, because it gives me more control and freedom when I need it. 👍👍👍

> Another cool library using SQL interpolation!

> I cannot recommend GRDB enough. It works well with Swift and eliminates whole classes of potential programming errors that can be made with Core Data. Also being able to use raw SQL queries if needed can be extremely useful!

> Just the occasional reminder that GRDB and its documentation is the gold standard. That's it.

> This is the future of Core Data

> I tried out GRDB since I saw you mention it a few days ago and absolutely love it. It’s so nice and testing the database logic is so much nicer than CoreData

> GRDB.swift is great! (I say this as the person that started SQLite.swift long ago.) And @groue’s very helpful and friendly.

> GRDB in already in my top3 when it comes to documentation. Clearly and pragmatically explained.

> Mixing SQLite / GRDB with Combine is my whole world right now, and it is delightful.

> It [Core Data] gets the job done, but folks made some really amazing Swift native sqlite wrappers.

> I LOVE GRDB and highly recommend it. If you don’t need it now, do keep it in mind for future because it’s great and the documentation and support are top notch.

> GRDB is quickly becoming the best package I have ever dealt with.
> What an exceptional piece of work: the philosophy, the documentation, the API, the abstractions, the Swiftiness👌

> GRDB keeps being the best-in-class interface to your database, and if you're not using it you're missing out. As always, amazing work from  @groue !

> Best SQLite/Swift integration 😀👍🏻

---

https://twitter.com/BelleBCooper/status/1192195655743111168

> I’ve been working on a side project recently that uses SwiftUI (+UIKit for parent controllers and nav), Combine, GRDB, and GRDBCombine for automatic updating based on DB changes. I’m really liking this setup.

---

https://twitter.com/BelleBCooper/status/1186034269577048064

> Working on a new project today and using GRDB by @groue for the backend. This is my go-to for new Swift projects. Highly recommend it!

> I think GRDB.swift is a godsend. So far sooooo good. (change my mind?)

> How had I never heard of GRDB before this week? Was I the only one missing out, or is this wonderful database library from  @groue news to you all too? https://buff.ly/2X8yHGf #iosdev

> Spent the last few weeks integrating it and it’s amazing! And this release brings a whole load more features—especially excited about eager loading of hasMany relationships.
>
> Quite possibly one of the best documented open source libs I’ve come across as well👌🏼

> It’s a great successor for FMDB with tons of great stuff. Worth a look, we have choose it in our new project even if, actually, I preferred not using some of the ‘ORM’ like features.

> Woohoo! Absolutely superb Swift library for SQLite - I love it 😀

> I love the way issues are handled in GRDB (SQLite for Swift). Groue is so friendly, and always goes above-and-beyond in helping to solve problems or explore new features for the library. It makes me happy to be a GRDB user.
