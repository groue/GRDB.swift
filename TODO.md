Not sure

- [ ] HiddenColumnsAdapter
- [ ] Not sure: type safety for SQL expressions
    - [ ] Introduce some record protocol with an associated primary key type. Restrict filter(key:) methods to this type. Allow distinguishing FooId from BarId types.
    - [ ] Replace Column with TypedColumn. How to avoid code duplication (repeated types)? Keypaths?
- [ ] Encode/decode nested records/arrays/dictionaries as JSON?
- [ ] Cursor.underestimatedCount, which could speed up Array(cursor) and fetchAll()
- [ ] Support for OR ROLLBACK, and mismatch between the Swift depth and the SQLite depth of nested transactions/savepoint:
    
    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {           // Swift depth: 1, SQLite depth: 1
        try db.execute("COMMIT")     // Swift depth: 1, SQLite depth: 0
        try db.execute("INSERT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        try db.execute("SELECT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        return .commit 
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {
        try db.execute("INSERT OR ROLLBACK ...") // throws 
        return .commit // not executed because of error
    }   // Should not ROLLBACK since transaction has already been rollbacked
    ```

    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {
        do {
            try db.execute("INSERT OR ROLLBACK ...") // throws
        } catch {
        }
        try db.execute("INSERT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        try db.execute("SELECT ...") // Should throw an error since this statement is no longer protected by a transaction
        return .commit
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    try db.inTransaction {
        do {
            try db.execute("INSERT OR ROLLBACK ...") // throws
        } catch {
        }
        return .commit  // Should throw an error since transaction has been rollbacked and user's intent can not be applied
    }
    ```


Requires recompilation of SQLite:

- [ ] https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_database_name.html could help extracting out of a row a subrow only made of columns that come from a specific table. Requires SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA which is not set on the sqlite3 lib that ships with OSX.
