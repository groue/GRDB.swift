- [ ] Make FetchRequest adopt Equatable
- [ ] FetchedRecordsController needs a property that disables changes computation and calls to delegate.controller(_:didChangeRecord:withEvent:).
- [ ] Turn FetchedRecordsController.setRequest into the request property setter.
- [ ] DatabaseValue.failableValue() is not a nice name.
- [ ] Support for resource values (see https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1719/_index.html)
- [ ] DOC: Write an app like http://www.appcoda.com/swiftydb/ ?
- [ ] DOC: Since commit e6010e334abdf98eb9f62c1d6abbb2a9e8cd7d19, one can not use the raw SQLite API without importing the SQLite module for the platform. We need to document that.
- [ ] Query builder
    - [ ] SELECT readers.*, books.* FROM ... JOIN ...
    - [ ] date functions
    - [ ] NOW
    - [ ] RANDOM() https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html
    - [ ] LIKE https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] GLOB https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] MATCH https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] REGEXP https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html
    - [ ] CASE x WHEN w1 THEN r1 WHEN w2 THEN r2 ELSE r3 END https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html

Not sure:

- [ ] Turn DatabaseWriter.readFromWrite to Database.readFromCurrentState { ... } ?
- [ ] Refactor errors in a single type?
- [ ] Since Records' primary key are infered, no operation is possible on the primary key unless we have a Database instance. It's impossible to define the record.primaryKey property, or to provide a copy() function that does not clone the primary key: they miss the database that is the only object aware of the primary key. Should we change our mind, and have Record explicitly expose their primary key again?
- [ ] Have Record adopt Hashable and Equatable, based on primary key. Problem: we can't do it know because we don't know the primary key until we have a database connection.


Require changes in the Swift language:

- [ ] Specific and optimized Optional<StatementColumnConvertible>.fetch... methods when http://openradar.appspot.com/22852669 is fixed.


Requires recompilation of SQLite:

- [ ] https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_database_name.html could help extracting out of a row a subrow only made of columns that come from a specific table. Requires SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA which is not set on the sqlite3 lib that ships with OSX.
