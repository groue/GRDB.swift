    /// Creates an optimized `ValueObservation` that notifies the fetched value
    /// whenever it changes.
    ///
    /// Unlike observations created with ``tracking(_:)``, the returned
    /// observation can reduce database contention, by not blocking
    /// database writes when fresh values are fetched. It can also avoid
    /// fetching fresh values from the main thread, after the database was
    /// modified on the main thread.
    ///
    /// Those scheduling optimizations are only applied when the observation
    /// is started from a ``DatabasePool``. You can start such an
    /// observation from a ``DatabaseQueue``, but the optimizations will not
    /// be applied. The notified values will be the same, though. This makes
    /// it possible to use a pool in the main application, and an in-memory
    /// queue in tests and Xcode previews.
    ///
    /// **Precondition**: The `fetch` function must perform requests that fetch
    /// from a single and constant database region. This region is made of
    /// tables, columns, and rowids of individual rows. All changes that happen
    /// outside of this region are not notified.
    ///
    /// For example, the observations below track a constant region and can
    /// be optimized:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Tracks the full 'player' table
    /// let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -> [Player] in
    ///     try Player.fetchAll(db)
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Tracks the row with id 42 in the 'player' table
    /// let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -> Player? in
    ///     try Player.fetchOne(db, key: 42)
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Tracks the 'score' column in the 'player' table
    /// let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -> Int? in
    ///     try Int.fetchOne(db, sql: "SELECT MAX(score) FROM player")
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Tracks both the 'player' and 'team' tables

    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// **Observations that do not track a constant database region must not
    /// use this method, because some changes may not be notified to
    /// the application.**
    ///
    /// For example, the observations below do not track a constant region.
    /// They are correctly defined with ``tracking(_:)``, since

    ///     let playerId: Int64 = config.favoritePlayerId
    ///     return try Player.find(db, id: playerId)

    /// // Does not always track the 'player' table, or not always the same
    /// // rows in the 'player' table:
    /// let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db -> [Player] in
    ///     let config = try AppConfiguration.find(db)
    ///     let playerIds: [Int64] = config.favoritePlayerIds
    ///     // Not only playerIds can change, but when it is empty,
    ///     // the player table is not tracked at all.
    ///     return try Player.fetchAll(db, ids: playerIds)

    ///
    /// // Sometimes tracks the 'food' table, and sometimes the 'beverage' table.
