        // > acquired until the first read or write operation. [...] Because the
        // > acquisition of locks is deferred until they are needed, it is
        // > possible that another thread or process could create a separate

        //
        // The readFromCurrentState method says that no change should be visible
        // at all. We thus have to perform a select that establishes the
